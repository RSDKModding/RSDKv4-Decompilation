# 1.2.0 Menu (Moddable Ver.)
so basically when its done just plop the thing in your mods folder (assuming you're using 1.1.2) and bam you got the menus!!!! woo!!!!!!


mildly panicking because github was like "do a pull request." so i was just like "whatever" thinking that it was just gonna go to my fork but NAH!!! it goes to the original decomp and i cant close it so thats awesome
